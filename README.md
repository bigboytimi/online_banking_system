This is a mini-project to test my knowledge of the C programming language.

It is an online banking program that works on the command line. It covers peculiar concepts and built-in functions of the C programming langauges.

This program includes features:

# REGISTRATION
# FUND DEPOSIT
# FUND WITHDRAWAL
# ONLINE FUND TRANSFER
# PASSWORD UPDATE

More features will be added later.

This project is open for collaboration. If there is any addition you'd like to make, send a pull request for review.
